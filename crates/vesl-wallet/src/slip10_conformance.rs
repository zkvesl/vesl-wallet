//! The frozen cross-implementation KAT for SLIP-10 derivation.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! Before it, every test of `hd.rs` was **relational** — determinism,
//! "distinct inputs give distinct keys", "this role differs from that
//! one". Not one pinned an actual key value. That is exactly the shape in
//! which a wrong adoption of a standard is invisible: a construction that
//! is SLIP-10-*shaped* but disagrees with upstream on any detail passes
//! every relational test while deriving the wrong keys.
//!
//! ⚠️ **What "wrong" means here, precisely.** Not *invalid*. The chain
//! never validates how a key was derived: a lock is a `%pkh`, a hash of a
//! public key, and `slip10.hoon` is imported by the wallet app and its
//! tests alone — by nothing on any consensus path. A non-conforming
//! derivation still yields a perfectly good Cheetah keypair that signs
//! and spends normally, which is why nothing on a test network would ever
//! have complained. What breaks is **interoperability and recovery**: the
//! same seed phrase in `nockchain-wallet`, in iris, or in a future
//! hardware wallet produces a DIFFERENT key. So a refund sent to
//! `Authorization.from` lands where its owner cannot reach it, and an
//! operator importing their phrase into the reference wallet finds an
//! empty account. That is the failure this file exists to prevent, and it
//! is invisible to every other test in the crate.
//!
//! ## What "conformance" means here
//!
//! Not "agrees with a third-party wallet". The vectors in
//! [`reference_wallet`] are the output of **`nockchain-wallet` itself**,
//! reached through `iris-rs/crates/iris-crypto/src/slip10.rs:121-162`,
//! which freezes that CLI's `keygen` / `derive-child` output. So a green
//! run here says: *this crate derives the same keys the chain's own
//! reference wallet derives from the same seed phrase.*
//!
//! ## Why it is a unit test and not `tests/`
//!
//! The reference vectors pin the master key and DEPTH-1 children. The
//! public API only ever walks the full five-level BIP-44 path, so an
//! integration test structurally cannot express them.
//! [`five_role_path`] does use the public API, and asserts the two agree.
//!
//! ## Regenerating
//!
//! `python3 tools/slip10_vectors.py` re-derives everything except the
//! non-hardened branch straight from `nockchain/hoon/common/slip10.hoon`
//! and self-tests against the same reference vectors. Run it if upstream
//! ever moves: it will say which vector changed, in seconds, instead of
//! leaving a wall of unexplainable constants behind.
